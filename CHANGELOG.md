#### Week 1
Made `Simple Calculator`
1. It can handle any number of variable assignments and calculations using semicolons in same line. 
2. Prints the variables store inside the symbol table on pressing ENTER
3. Can also handle Brackets i.e. `(10 + 20) * 30` will give `900` and `10 + 20 * 30`  will give `610`.
4. Also Supports string variable names following `[a-zA-Z]+` rule.

#### Week 2
Initial compiler
1. Created a String type, which was used to store levels while printing the parse tree.
2. Added functionality to store multiple children for each node. using .next pointer
3. Stack to create the Syntax tree.
4. Printing the output of each write statement

#### Week 3
Part 1
* double type implemented
* any depth array implemented
* leak fixes

Part 2
* removed stack 
* removed evaluation of expr while creating syntax tree
* print fixed with new approach

Part 3
